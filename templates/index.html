		<h1 id=about>About</h1>
		<p><a href=/>FicHub</a> is a growing set of accessibility tools for reading
			fanfiction. After entering a URL and clicking <span class=b>Export</span>,
			basic fic metadata and a link to download as a standard EPUB will
			appear. Additionally, links to generate and download MOBI, PDF, or
			Zipped HTML versions will show.</p>
		<p>The EPUB format is recommended, as many EPUB readers have options to
			change font, font size, colors, and have other options to enhance
			readability. This includes the option to change to a dyslexia friendly
			font.</p>
		<p>Looking for something new to read? <a href='https://fic.ai'>Fic.AI</a> is
		an in development project aiding discovery. More advanced features are
		coming, but until then consider checking out
		<a href='https://fic.ai/popular'>the popular page</a>.</p>
		<p>Feel free to <a href=#contact>get in touch</a>.</p>

		<h2 id=help>If you run into issues</h2>
		<p>In order to be a good citizen of the web, FicHub caches content and
			throttles the request rate on upstream sources. This means that some
			fics may take a while to export. Better progress reporting is in the
			works. Until then, please give it some time before trying to re-export a
			fic if you encounter an issue.</p>
		<p>Content may be stale at times, but an automated background task
			<i>should</i> catch all updates eventually. If a fic is stale and you'd
			like to request it to be refreshed immediately, please ask
			<a href=#contact>in the discord or on IRC</a>.</p>

		<h2 id=bookmarklet>Bookmarklet</h2>
		<p>A <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet'>bookmarklet</a>
			is a small piece of code that can be saved as a bookmark to provide
			extra functionality when clicked. While viewing a fic, click the FicHub
			bookmarklet to be navigated to FicHub and automatically export the fic
			you were just looking at. You may be able drag the following link to
			your bookmarks, or right click it to save as a bookmark:
			<a href="javascript:location.href='https://fichub.net/?b=1&q='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)">Export on FicHub</a>.
		</p>
		<p>Alternatively, copy and paste the following code as the destination of
			a new bookmark:</p>
		<p class=c><code>javascript:location.href='https://fichub.net/?b=1&amp;q='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)</code></p>
