# Apparently the consumers of ads.txt are unable to understand the difference
# between an empty file and no file (404), so "at least one properly formatted
# line must be included." Therefore, for an intentionally "empty" ads.txt,
# v1.0.2 (2019-03-04) of the spec recommends using this placeholder record:
placeholder.example.com, placeholder, DIRECT, placeholder
