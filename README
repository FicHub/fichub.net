# Setup

There are several additional components needed that are not currently covered
by requirements.txt if you want a fully functioning instance of FicHub, though
several of these may be omitted:

	python-oil:
		grab from https://github.com/FanFicDev/python-oil

	typescript:
		used for frontend js

	sass:
		used for frontend styling

	alexandria api access:
		used to lookup fic metadata and fetch content

		copy authentications.ex.py to authentications.py and fill in credentials
		to self host, see https://github.com/FanFicDev/hermes

	postgres:
		used to store all metadata

		If a new database is created for a new instance, the OIL_DB_DBNAME env
		variable likely needs updated in the run and dump_db scripts.

	elasticsearch:
		used for search fallback when a fic is not found

	calibre:
		used to generate mobi and pdf formats


See https://github.com/FicHub/infra-dev if you're interested in using Docker
to run a dev instance.
